This is a calculator project that functions like any real calculator.

I broke this project down into smaller sub problems by having each function do one task. The title of each function explains what it does. These functions are then called inside of the event listeners for each of the buttons. I also add keyboard functionality where you can type in your calculations instead of click on the individual buttons on the calculator.

## Optimizations

If/when I improve this project, I would start by either removing the footer or pushing it down to the bottom of the viewport.

## Lessons Learned:

I got more practice with problem solving. Separation of concerns.
